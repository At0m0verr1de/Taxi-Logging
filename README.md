[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/aryan-bakshii/Taxi-Logging/blob/main/LICENSE)

This repository contains a taxi logging application developed using Java, Swing, and MySQL. The application was built as part of an internship project for a restaurant chain in Ambala, Haryana. The goal of the project was to digitize their logging and incentivization process, replacing the traditional pen-and-paper approach.

The application allows taxi drivers to log their trips, record important information such as pick-up and drop-off locations, distance traveled, fare, and other relevant details. The data is stored in a MySQL database, providing a centralized and efficient way to manage and track taxi operations.

## Features

- User-friendly interface built with Java Swing, providing an intuitive and responsive experience.
- Seamless integration with a MySQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Log trips with details such as pick-up and drop-off locations, distance, and fare.
- Generate reports and analyze taxi data for performance evaluation and decision-making.
- Improve efficiency and accuracy by eliminating manual paperwork.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryan-bakshii/Taxi-Logging.git
